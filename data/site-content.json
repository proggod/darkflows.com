      {
        "question": "Is DarkFlows free to use?",
        "answer": "DarkFlows is free to use and our intent is to keep it that way."

        "question": "Why is CAKE better then solutions on pfSense and OPNsense?",

      {
        "question": "Why put applications and file sharing on the same system?",
        "answer": "For most people having one system to rule them all is the best solution.  We have designed DarkFlows to be a very light weight OS that can run on a very inexpensive system and still provide all the features you need."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do I do before installing DarkFlows?",
        "answer": "Make sure you have your WAN and LAN ports set up before installing DarkFlows.  Our installer auto detects your network configuration and will configure your system accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I access the DarkFlows dashboard?",
        "answer": "You can just visit the default IP address at http://192.168.58.1/ to access the dashboard.  It will then redirect you to port 4080."

        "question": "What are the default passwords and usernames?",

      }
      ,
      {
        "question": "Can I access the web interface from the internet?",
        "answer": "By default the web interface is only accessible from the local network.  It is not recommended to expose the web interface to the internet at this time until we add additional security measures for user authentication."
      }
      ,
      {
        "question": "Isn't it dangerous to have NAS and other applications on my router?",
        "answer": "In our opinions there is an elevated risk, however one that for the average user is minimal.  The entire router is firewalled from the internet, so the only attack vector is inside your network.  However what is great about our system is you get to choose rather you have other applications enabled our not.  We are just creating our ultimate solution, it is up to the user what they do with it."
      }
      ,
      {
        "question": "What are some good things to use to troubleshoot issues?",
        "answer": "Use 'systemctl status kea-ctrl-agent.service' to see if DHCP is running. Use to 'cat /etc/darkflows/d_network.cfg' to see if at least two network interfaces are there. Use 'systemctl status nextjs' to see if webserver is running. Use 'ip addr show' to see what interfaces are setup. Use 'cat /etc/network/interfaces' to see what interfaces are configured."
